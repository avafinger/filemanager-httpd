    <h2>filemanager-httpd</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; padding: 1em">
    This is <em>filemanager-httpd</em> welcome file. It looks like no share
    is specified in configuration file. Please feel invited to adjust
    the server configuration. Look at <code>/etc/filemanager-httpd.d/</code>
    directory.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>
    All files in directory <code>/etc/filemanager-httpd.d/</code> with
    <code>.conf</code> suffix are read by the server. One configuration file,
    <code>default.conf</code>, is placed in this directory during installation.
    This file contains well explained all available options. All options in
    the file are commented out. It is worth to make a copy of this file and
    modify the copy. If the <code>default.conf</code> file will be modified,
    the change will be a problem for installer during installation of a new
    version of the file.
    </p>
    <h4>Shares</h4>
    <p>
    The only thing really needed to set in the configuration file is adding of
    at least one <em>share</em>.  The <em>share</em> is a mapping of URL path
    to path in file system.  For example, look at the share below:
    <blockquote>
        / = /home/fred/Public
    </blockquote>
    The definition contains URL path followed by equal sign and then
    corresponding path in file system. Both paths must be absolute, i.e.
    shall begin with slash. With this definition request for e.g.
    <code>http://www.example.com/index.html</code> serves file
    <code>/home/fred/Public/index.html</code>. HTTP request for
    <code>http://www.example.com/</code> results with
    <code>/home/fred/Public</code> directory listing. If the running server has
    permission to modify the directory contents, the page with directory
    listing will also contain a form to upload a file to server.  This is the
    server default behavior and if undesired, the upload possibility may
    be disabled in configuration file. It is also possible to turn off
    directory listing. By default the server has enabled all capabilities
    without restrictions. Although the server drops root privileges after
    startup thus most of the files in file system cannot be altered this
    way. The server may even have no access to the
    <code>/home/fred/Public</code> directory and <cite>403 Forbidden</cite>
    error message may be displayed instead of the directory listing.
    </p>
    <p>
    Among all shares matching request such with longest URL path is taken to
    look at the file to serve.  If the configuration file contains more than
    one share with the same URL path, the share defined later is taken.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is not neccessary to provide a share for <code>/</code> (i.e. root).
    If such share is not defined and directory listing is enabled, request
    for <code>/</code> will return a pseudo-directory listing with all
    available shares. Try it out.
    </p>
    <h4>Index files</h4>
    <p>
    The server has also a possibility to specify <em>index files</em>. The
    index file is a file served when URL path refers to a directory.  Index
    files may be specified using <code>index</code> setting. For example:
    <blockquote>
        index = index.html index.htm welcome.html
    </blockquote>
    If a directory contains one of the index files, it is served.
    Otherwise the directory listing is generated, provided that
    directory listing feature is enabled. If not, error <cite>404 Not
    Found</cite> is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
    The order of files on list specifies the files precedence in case when
    more than one of the index files exist in directory. The file specified
    earlier on list has higher priority.
    </p>
    <h4>CGI support</h4>
    <p>
    The server may also execute CGI scripts. CGI handling is rather
    straightforward. The <code>cgi</code> setting in configuration file
    allows to set patterns to distinguish CGI programs from usual files.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, the definition below treats all files with cgi extension
    as CGI programs to execute:
    <blockquote>
        cgi = *.cgi
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Sample CGI script below prints out the CGI program whole environment:

    <blockquote style="white-space: pre">#!/bin/sh
cat &lt;&lt;End
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Environment&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
End
set | sed -e 's/&amp;/\&amp;amp;/g' -e 's/&lt;/\&amp;lt;/g'
cat &lt;&lt;End
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
End</blockquote>

    Don't forget to set the script execute permission. Otherwise internal
    server error will be displayed by server instead of the script output.
